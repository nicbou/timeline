# Timeline

Point it at your files, and it generates a timeline of your life as a static website. See your photos, videos, diary entries, geolocation history and bank transactions day by day. Scroll through your data the same way you scroll through your photos.

This project does the same thing as the [old timeline](https://github.com/nicbou/timeline-old), but it's much simpler and lighter.
